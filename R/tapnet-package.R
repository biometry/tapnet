#'   \item{0.2; 19-Sep-2019}{Tinoco-data updated to now also contain external abundances (thanks Boris for providing these!). Help file for these data updated accordingly. By now we have used tapnet on many simulations and some real data and are fairly confident that the functions work as they should. The real test comes when data are not carefully prepared, with corrupted names and in non-alphabetical order, networks have NAs and so forth. Hopefully we have coded properly for these cases, too.}
#'   \item{0.1}{Initial version with all functions complete and a data set for demonstration. Code written by Gita Benadi, Carsten Dormann and Jochen Fr√ºnd, data provided by Boris Tinoco.}
