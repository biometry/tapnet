# tapnet: Fit and predict interaction frequency in bipartite network using traits, abundance and phylogeny

This package contains an assortment of functions to produce, fit and predict from bipartite networks with abundance, trait and phylogenetic information.

Currently this package is maintained by Carsten Dormann, that's why the repository is hosted under this department.

It falls onto the maintainer to submit new versions to CRAN for release. All non-CRAN-versions are in development, which you can install using the following code (only if you have the tool-chain installed, see R instructions):

    library(devtools)
    install_github("biometry/tapnet/tapnet")

Since I do not use github every day, please also send me an email if you add/change something (carsten.dormann@biom.uni-freiburg.de). Thanks!

If you want to add/change something, please add as many comments as possible into the R-code (to make other understand what you are doing) and set up the Roxygen-style documentation for new functions accordingly.


Carsten
